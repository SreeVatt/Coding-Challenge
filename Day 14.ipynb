    "Linear Search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in an array until the target element is found or the end of the array is reached.\n",

    "Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate through the array: Start from the first element and iterate through each element.\n",
    "Compare with target: Compare the current element with the target element.\n",
    "Return if found: If the current element is equal to the target, return its index.\n",
    "Continue searching: If the current element is not equal to the target, continue searching the next element.\n",
    "Return not found: If the end of the array is reached without finding the target, return a value indicating that the element is not found (e.g., -1).\n",

    "Time Complexity: Â  \n",
    "\n",
    "Worst case: O(n) (when the target element is not present or is the last element)\n",
    "Best case: O(1) (when the target element is the first element)\n",

    "Advantages:\n",

    "Simple to understand and implement.\n",

    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inefficient for large arrays due to its linear time complexity.\n",
    "Not suitable for real-world applications where performance is critical."
